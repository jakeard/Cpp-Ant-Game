# C++ Ant Game

This is my **C++ Ant Game** software. I decided to make this game to gain greater knowledge of and showcase my understanding of C++ from my research. This game gives you about 30 seconds to control an ant and eat fruit that is randomly placed around the screen. At the end, your highscore is saved and will display the next time you play.

## Thoughts About C++

After learning and working with C++ for a little bit now, I can easily say that it is a great programming language. I am most used to Python, and coming to C++ from Python was a bit difficult, as C++ makes specifications very important, especially with types. Overall, from learning the syntax to making this game, I can say that I have enjoyed using, and will continue to use C++. Give it a try!

## Development Environment

Some tools that I used to make this game are:

* C++
* Visual Studio
* VCPKG
* PDCurses library

## Useful Websites

* [PDCurses Website](http://pdcurses.org)
* [W3 Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/cpp)
* [GeekforGeeks](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org)
* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com)

## Future Work

* Turn this into a snake game
* Switch to use real visuals instead of just ASCII characters
* Add obstacles or enemies
