# C++ Ant Game

This is my **C++ Ant Game** software. I decided to make this game to gain greater knowledge of and showcase my understanding of C++ from my research. This game gives you about 30 seconds to control an ant and eat fruit that is randomly placed around the screen. At the end, your highscore is saved and will display the next time you play.  

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
